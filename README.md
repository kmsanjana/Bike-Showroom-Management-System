The entitled project “ONLINE BIKE SHOWROOM DATABASE MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM” provides solution for showrooms for organizing data using web application. This 
application helps administrator to update data in step by step process while selling vehicle to 
customer. Using this system management team can view customer’s information, vehicle 
information, payment details, and take orders etc. Showroom web is presently used in every 
car, bike showrooms for computerizing entire system.
Bike showroom management system provides the complete process of selling a bike to a 
customer from the dealer’s showroom .Before selling, the bike belongs to the fixed asset of the 
dealer’s showroom. So the main point of this scenario is posting the bike from a fixed asset to 
a current asset. While executing the process, the dealer can manually maintain the bike business 
transaction type, which means the bike can be set as a new or used bike to sell to the customer.
The scenario of the entire process goes like this. First the dealer purchases the bike from 
company. The customer wants to buy bike from dealer’s showroom .The dealer creates a sales 
order for the end customer. The customer confirms the order. The dealer creates a service order 
to prepare the bike
