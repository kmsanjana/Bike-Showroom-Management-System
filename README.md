The entitled project “ONLINE BIKE SHOWROOM DATABASE MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM” provides solution for showrooms for organizing data using web application. This 
application helps administrator to update data in step by step process while selling vehicle to 
customer. Using this system management team can view customer’s information, vehicle 
information, payment details, and take orders etc. Showroom web is presently used in every 
car, bike showrooms for computerizing entire system.
Bike showroom management system provides the complete process of selling a bike to a 
customer from the dealer’s showroom .Before selling, the bike belongs to the fixed asset of the 
dealer’s showroom. So the main point of this scenario is posting the bike from a fixed asset to 
a current asset. While executing the process, the dealer can manually maintain the bike business 
transaction type, which means the bike can be set as a new or used bike to sell to the customer.
The scenario of the entire process goes like this. First the dealer purchases the bike from 
company. The customer wants to buy bike from dealer’s showroom .The dealer creates a sales 
order for the end customer. The customer confirms the order. The dealer creates a service order 
to prepare the bike

# Final Say :) :

It has been a great pleasure for me to work on this exciting and challenging project. This 
project proved good for me as it provided practical knowledge of Phpmyadmin and no 
some extent Windows Application and SQL Server, but also about all handling procedure 
related with “VEHICLE SHOWROOM DATABASE SYSTEM”. It also provides 
knowledge about the latest technology used in developing stand alone application and 
client server technology that will be great demand in future. This will provide better 
opportunities and guidance in future in developing projects independently. This project 
offers user to enter the data through simple and interactive forms. This is very helpful for 
the client to enter the desired information through so much simplicity. The user is mainly 
more concerned about the validity of the data, whatever he is entering. There are checks 
on every stages of any new creation, data entry or updation so that the user cannot enter 
the invalid data, which can create problems at later date. Sometimes the user finds in the 
later stages of using project that he needs to update some of the information that he entered 
earlier. There are options for him by which he can update the records. Moreover there is 
restriction for his that he cannot change the primary data field. This keeps the validity of 
the data to longer extent. User is provided the option of monitoring the records he entered 
earlier. He can see the desired records with the variety of options provided by him. From 
every part of the project the user is provided with the links through framing so that he can 
go from one option of the project to other as per the requirement. This is bound to be 
simple and very friendly as per the user is concerned. That is, we can say that the project 
is user friendly which is one of the primary concerns of any good project. Data storage 
and retrieval will become faster and easier to maintain because data is stored in a 
systematic manner and in a single database. Further it can be implemented for large size 
of customers, dealers and with the admin who will be having control over the functions 
performed, for all the automated purchase of a bike anywhere and anytime even with using 
a simple smart phone to access the website
